Carnival Band Management System
CSEC Information Technology School-Based Assessment
This project was developed to support the management of a carnival band as described in the CSEC Information Technology School-Based Assessment (SBA). The system provides a computerized solution for organizing masqueraders, tracking payments, managing band sections, and informing the public about the carnival band.
The carnival band consists of five named sections, each with different costume costs and amenities. Masqueraders register to play in a section and may pay either the full cost of their costume or by installments. All personal and payment data are stored in a database and are used to generate reports, queries, and correspondence.
The project includes:
A Spreadsheet System to calculate costume costs, installment payments, inclusive fees, income, and expenditure for each section.
A Database System to store masqueraders’ personal information, payment details, and section data, and to generate queries and reports as required by the SBA.
A Web Page that provides the public with information about the carnival band, costume prices by section, and links to contact the Carnival Commission.
An Algorithm and Program Implementation that determines the section a masquerader plays in based on the amount paid and calculates the number of masqueraders and total payments for each section.
This system helps the bandleader to efficiently manage the financial records and organization of the carnival band, ensuring that the event is successfully planned and executed.
